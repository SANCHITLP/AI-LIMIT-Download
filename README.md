# About This Game

* Explore the unknown apocalyptic world

After the sudden yet mysterious collapse of the artificial ecosystem, natural disasters and wars ensued, the civilization was wiped out. And in the centuries that followed, a strange substance known as the Mud spread everywhere, and monsters emerged.
You will step into the last city of mankind - Havenswell, exploring cold and damp sewers, layers of slums, sky city above the lake, etc., seeking the truth about the destruction of civilization in monster-infested ruins. Travel through wonders, face mysterious and deadly enemies, and put an end to an eerie and desperate history.

A journey with a mysterious mission

Now that the Branches have been destroyed, you, as one of the Bladers, will have to search for and repair the Branches all over the city. You will meet humans and fellow Bladers who are also in dire straits, feel their joys and sorrows, as well as their faith in despair, and together uncover the truth behind the plagues and disasters.
